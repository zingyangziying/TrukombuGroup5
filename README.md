# TrukombuGroup5

Fancy Some TruKombu Kombucha?

Unfortunately, this is a fictional website that’s a result of a group project effort. However, we do hope that you’ve enjoyed browsing the website as much as we’ve enjoyed creating it!

We are a group of aspiring full stack developers participating in Generation Singapore’s SGUP-CT Jr Full Stack Developer #GetReadySG bootcamp. This website serves as our final project before graduation!

In this project, we covered:<br>
Persistence: MySQL Database.<br>
Backend: REST API with Java and Springboot.<br>
Frontend: JavaScript + CSS + HTML<br>

We would love to connect with you! You can find us on LinkedIn at:<br>
